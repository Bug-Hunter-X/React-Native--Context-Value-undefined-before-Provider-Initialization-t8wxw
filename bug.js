This error occurs when you use a component that relies on a context value that hasn't been initialized yet.  This frequently happens when the context provider is higher up in the component tree than the component that's trying to consume the value.  The component might try to render before the provider has had a chance to pass down its data. This often manifests with seemingly random errors or unexpected behavior depending on component rendering order.  For instance:

```javascript
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { MyContext } from './MyContext';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const contextValue = useContext(MyContext);
  console.log(contextValue); // Might be undefined if MyContext hasn't finished rendering
  return (
    <div>{contextValue?.someValue}</div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
